# I’m a [multipotentialite][mp] musician who codes

I've been working in both music and technology since 1995. I'm a **full-stack software engineer** with broad knowledge and interests, though with very deep expertise in some areas.

I am also a skilled **guitarist** and **music producer** and enjoy writing music and jamming with bands, possibly with plenty of distorted guitars.

In 2019, I started the [BlueMelt][bm] ~instrumental~ guitar rock project.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on new music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++, Assembly
